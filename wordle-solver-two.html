                    <p> If you haven't read part 1, please check it out before reading this update. To remind all of us about the edge cases I hoped to 
                        check, here is the list again:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We need to account for words where the same letter is repeated. These are not likely to be the correct word.</li>
                        <li>We should ideally pick words that use the most new letters as compared to previous words to gain the most data.</li>
                        <li>At a certain point, we need to stop guessing from the list of all 5 letter words, and shift over to the list of 
                            acceptable wordle answers, which is a much smaller subset of all 5 letter words.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In order to account for repeated letters, I made a simple algorithm that adds all the letters in a word to a set. For 
                        those unfamiliar with the set data structure (in this case a HashSet), a set takes in distinct values only. In other words,
                        if a 5 letter word has the letter 'C' twice, then when the second 'C' is added to the set, nothing changes, because it is 
                        not distinct from the first 'C'. Therefore, each time there is a repeated letter, the size of the set is one smaller. this
                        method also accounts for situations where two seperate letters are both repeated in a word, since the set will grab both 
                        letters once, and not add the repeated letters for either of the initial letters. Ideally, if a word has no repeated letters,
                        then the set would have 5 elements, or a size of 5. Therefore, to adjust the weights of words for repeated letters, we just 
                        multiply the initial weight by the size of the set, then divide by 5. For words with no repeating letters, this is the same 
                        as doing nothing since we effectively multiply by 5 then divide by 5. <br><br>
                        Fortunately, after testing, we saw that the second case I was worried about was handled automatically by the combination 
                        of the weights being adjusted for repeating letters and weights being based on character positional frequencies. <br><br>
                        As for the third case, testing also revealed to us that our algorithm already accounts for it? But how can the algorithm
                        already guess words that belong to the valid Wordle answer set without knowing it? Well, the list of Wordle answers is 
                        actually composed of common 5 letter words, which means our character positional frequencies already weight those words 
                        higher than 5 letter words that are more uncommon. Furthermore, my collaborator, Oscar Goes, brought up the valid point 
                        that if we switch to the Wordle answer set for the 6th guess, we are pretty much cheating. By using only frequency data,
                        we solve this issue and stay true to the algorithm. <br><br>
                        All isn't well, however, because we encountered a new issue while running tests. In fact, this issue is common when 
                        running a variant of Wordle called <a href="https://qntm.org/files/absurdle/absurdle.html">Absurdle</a>. The issue arises 
                        when four of the five letters are discovered, but there are two many fifth letter possibilities left for our solver to handle. 
                        Here is an example: 
                    </p>
                    <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/uhoh!.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>	
                    <p> You might think that not that many words are left for the solver to choose from, but here is what we had left in the list, along
                        with the weights:
                    </p>
                    <pre><code>gatch: 4298
latch: 4237
watch: 4073
hatch: 3319</code></pre>
                    <p> Right now, the only idea I have to solve this is to do a check on the fourth word: are four of the letters found? If four of the 
                        letters are green, then we use the remaining fifth letter possibilites to form a sort of temp word. In this case, instead of guessing
                        "match" for the fifth word, we would try to find a word with as many of the 5th letters left as possible. This would be a word made up of
                        'm', 'g', 'l', 'w', and 'h,' or as many of these letters as possible. A good try by the solver might be "glamp", which gets four of these.
                        This would be the fifth word tried, and would ultimately tell us if 'h' is the letter (if all the ones we try in "glamp" are black) or if 
                        one of the letters in "glamp" is the fifth letter. Then, for the 6th word, we will know exactly what the word is, or at least be significantly
                        closer.
                    </p>
