                    <p> A fair portion of the UTCS department’s sophomore class would argue that I’m quite good at I/O, especially when it comes to 
                        interleaving OS puns into my everyday speech. My roommates and I do this as an ongoing joke, even with Computer Architecture curriculum 
                        from last year. You are never confused in my apartment, it’s just that your condition flags are wrong. The fridge never needs to be 
                        organized, we just need to use compaction. And my personal favorite, you didn’t forget the word you’re looking for, you just have a 
                        small sized RAM. These ridiculous jokes probably incite laughter more from their ridiculous nature than their humor, but making them 
                        has always been my favorite way of studying and recalling important CS concepts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there comes a point where it becomes second nature, as if the part of the brain that makes these ridiculous comparisons is 
                        stored in cache (sorry). Unfortunately, this cache of mine is holding code that gets scheduled too often, and I began thinking about 
                        how homes are awfully like operating systems.

                        My home is like an operating system?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes. It absolutely is. Well, it at least follows a lot of the principles of one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let us start with something simple: utilities. How does water get to your house? Every home has a water main that is dedicated to 
                        connecting and regulating the pressure of water to your pipes. Your plumbing system also has a water pressure regulator to make sure 
                        that the water isn’t coming at speeds high enough to damage your pipes. This is oddly similar to network interface controllers and TCP 
                        (Transmission Control Protocol). The network interface control manages data communication for your specific device to the network, the 
                        way a water main handles water transfer from the city to your home. TCP also makes sure that the data window is at a reasonable size to 
                        prevent network congestion, similar to how the water pressure regulator makes sure the pressure is in a reasonable range.

                        Next we have electricity. The electricity meter and main panel can be considered the device on the motherboard that allows for 
                        communication through electricity. The main panel has all your switches to control which rooms or sections of your home have power, 
                        and for the sake of this post, let us think of each room as a process. Therefore when flipping switches on your main panel, you can 
                        consider yourself in kernel mode. When using the switches in your rooms, you are in user mode. Speaking of switches in your room, each 
                        switch is like a user thread for your room, which is the process as we established earlier. Multiple switches can be flipped in a room 
                        at the same time, as long as the room itself has power. In Operating System terms, your user threads are free to run as long as you don’t 
                        kill the process that they are all on. Furthermore, the kernel isn’t aware of these user threads (all you can do from your panel is kill 
                        or bring back processes, you can’t control an individual socket in your room). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I could go over gas as well, but I’m assuming you understand the general idea at this point. Now what else can we model through operating 
                        systems? Maybe we can look at some of the protection design principles. One of my favorites is separation of privileges. This is the idea 
                        that if a user needs one permission for one task, they shouldn’t unnecessarily be given access to other permissions. This could lead to 
                        security risks by giving the user too much power. However, in order to support this principle, the computer system needs to be designed in 
                        such a way that privileges only depend on each other when necessary. Now how is this mimicked in homes? Think of the water system. You might 
                        think that some electrical components are used to pump the water up to your actual sinks or higher floors, but that is not the case. The 
                        water system in your home is entirely mechanical! And if you were already aware of this, then you might wonder why electrical assistance is 
                        not used anywhere in the water system except for temperature. This is actually the case by intention, because if any crucial components of 
                        the water system were made electrical, then losing power would mean losing water as well, which is much more dangerous. This is why when you 
                        lose power to your home, you still have water. Sure, it may be cold, but at least you have it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another well known design principle is economy of mechanism. Keep components as simple as possible, and reuse existing working parts when 
                        possible. When it comes to the construction of your home, this is followed extremely well. No builder is trying to reinvent the window or 
                        door, these are products that exist and work, so builders just buy them and use them. Similarly, building techniques are reused. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now I could go on and on with different principles and laws and talk about multilevel feedback in two story AC units or how your attic is 
                        like your disk drive, but I won’t. There is an endless world of comparisons to be made between any two topics, and I figured I’d share a 
                        little about what goes through my head as a Computer Science major. As serious as the material can get, it can always be abstracted away 
                        into jokes, or maybe that’s just how I read my binary, whoever knows? :)
