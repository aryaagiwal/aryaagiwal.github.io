                    <p> If you haven’t already read <a href="home-os.html">Your Home as an OS</a>, I recommend skimming through that first, as it will explain why I’m writing 
                        this almost comical article on comparisons between streets and operating systems. I can’t be the only one who on long drives 
                        begins to wander, thinking about what might’ve been and what could be. And if you are me specifically, maybe you’ll think about 
                        Computer Science analogies…
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No point waiting any longer to get into it, let us start by assuming that your car is a process, and thus the people in the car 
                        are threads. If we want to be fancy and classify user and kernel threads, we can say the only kernel thread is the driver. This 
                        is because every process requires a kernel thread, just like how every car requires a driver. All the other threads, which sit 
                        in the car in parallel, quite literally, are user threads, which run with virtual parallelism. To the main operating system itself, 
                        which would be the streets, street lights, police officers, and everything else that plays a role in guiding your car from point A 
                        to B, the kernel thread of the car is responsible for the car itself. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, to broaden the scope of this analogy, let us look at street structures and classify them as components of an operating system. 
                        Firstly, we can claim that your home garage is like a low-level cache. It allows you to store your car rather efficiently, and this 
                        is because it exploits locality. On this same line of thought, we can argue that parking lots are also like caches, though not as 
                        low level, since they provide a much larger cache of cars, typically for locations with a lot more people than your home. As a 
                        result, they can sometimes not be nearly as fast. For example, imagine that you have parked in the last parking spot for a mall. 
                        The time it will take you to walk to the entrance of the mall will be much longer than it would have taken you to walk from your 
                        garage into your house. Now, in a sense, we have established both processes and caching those processes. In fact, it fits perfectly 
                        that your car would be cached while you are not using it, the same way a process can be cached when it is blocked or waiting on 
                        something external. Now if parking lots are the caches and processes are the cars, it only makes sense that the network of roads 
                        itself is an asymmetric multiprocessing system. Each individual road can be a CPU, and if the CPU has multiple lanes, it is a 
                        multi-core CPU. The reason that the road network is not a symmetric multiprocessing system is because not all roads are treated 
                        equally. We can say that the faster the road, the more prioritized it is in this system. Therefore highways are prioritized over 
                        street roads, proving the overall system asymmetric.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Something else we can look at is the process type. Not all cars are the same! We have trucks, buses, scooters, and the occasional 
                        genius who chooses to run on the road itself instead of the sidewalk. All of these, in our analogy, can be differentiated by process 
                        size (a truck will be a larger process than a car). Furthermore, vehicles that stop more often for people to get on or off can be 
                        considered I/O bound processes (city buses are I/O bound as a result). Based on this information, what type of scheduling algorithm 
                        does StreetOS use? Shortest job first, of course. We see it every day. Sports cars overtaking pickup trucks. Pickup trucks overtaking 
                        18 wheelers. And everything overtaking buses on street roads, especially when they stop at bus stands. Of course, the shortest job 
                        first scheduler is limited. Just like computers can only estimate which process will be shorter, drivers can only estimate which 
                        vehicle will make it down the road sooner. Sometimes trucks are faster than cars, and there is no way to predict this future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, the road network is much like an operating system in countless ways, and it makes sense as both require precise structuring 
                        and rules in order to optimize travel time or application runtime respectively. In the process of doing so, both implement a lot of the 
                        same principles, like taking advantage of locality, leading to so many comparable features. Hopefully the next time you are on the road, 
                        you appreciate some of the thought that has gone into planning the streets around you, as it is just as complex as an operating system in 
                        many ways.
