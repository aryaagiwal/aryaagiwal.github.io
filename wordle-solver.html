                        <h2>Wordle Solver: The Algorithmic Approach</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p> In response to the new craze that is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a>, <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/oscarjgoes>Oscar Goes</a> 
                        and I decided to take a crack at making a solver. However, unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA">3Blue1Brown who utilizes information theory in 
                        his solution's approach</a>, we decided to use fixed letter positional frequency values to determine the next best word. <br><br>
                        For those who don't know how Wordle works, here is a quick rundown of how a typical game goes:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>You enter a 5 letter word.</li>
                        <li>Wordle responds with data for each letter.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>If the letter turns green, you have correctly found the spot of the letter in the correct word.</li>
                                <li>If the letter turns yellow, you have found a letter in the correct word, but it's misplaced.</li>
                                <li>If the letter turns grey, it is not in the correct word.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>Based on this information, you enter another word.</li>
                        <li>If you run out of guesses, of which there are 6, you lose. If you guess it right, you win.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The first step in creating the solver is picking a word to use as the first guess. But what word works the best? According to 
                        <a href="https://bert.org/2021/11/24/the-best-starting-word-in-wordle/">Bertrand Fan</a>, soare is the best. From an initial glance, this 
                        actually seems to be like quite a good word - it has three vowels, an 's', and an 'r.' All 5 of these characters are very common in the 
                        English language. <i> To satisfy your curiosity, soare is an obsolete word defined as a young hawk.</i> <br><br>
                        With a first word out of the way, the next step was figuring out how to generate the next five words. First, we needed a word set with all 5 letter 
                        words, which we managed to find in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/main.3d28ac0c.js">code of Wordle itself</a>. From here, we 
                        used a set of character positional frequencies obtained through <a href="https://github.com/medicantBias117/wordle-bruteforce">Rameez Kakodker who tried a 
                        brute-force approach like us to solving Wordle.</a> Using the frequencies of every letter in each of the 5 possible spots, we generated weights for
                        all the possible guesses. 
                        <br><br>
                        Now, all that was left to do was shrink the list each time we made a guess. After our initial guess "soare," we look at which letters are green,
                        and eliminate every word that does not have that letter at that spot. We then look at the yellow letters, and remove every word that does not have 
                        that letter at least once. This leaves us with just a list of valid, updated possible guesses. From here, the weights we applied earlier come in handy,
                        but a few other factors are at play:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We need to account for words where the same letter is repeated. These are not likely to be the correct word.</li>
                        <li>We should ideally pick words that use the most new letters as compared to previous words to gain the most data.</li>
                        <li>At a certain point, we need to stop guessing from the list of all 5 letter words, and shift over to the list of 
                            acceptable wordle answers, which is a much smaller subset of all 5 letter words.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        All of these factors are not difficult but require various algorithms to run consistently and effectively. Without a lot of data, it is hard 
                        to pick points where the solver should start using words from the Wordle answer list and it is even more challenging to figure out when the 
                        solver should stop looking for words with the most new letters in them rather than guesses that are likely. <br><br>
                        Nonetheless, these are small hurdles in the long jounrey of making a Wordle solver, and with time, coffee, and repeated testing, we will
                        defeat Wordle with brute force.
