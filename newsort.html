                    </header>
                    <p> 
                        I'm currently taking a course here at UT Austin titled Competitive Programming, designed to train students to apply common algorthims to simple coding
                        challenges. Though my main intention in taking this course is to gain the ability to crack technical interviews and personal satisfaction in solving evil
                        LeetCode problems, I sometimes get lost in problems as I recreate old Computer Science discoveries. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Recently I was tackling <a href="https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/405/A/">Codeforces' Gravity Flip</a> problem, in which you need to slide
                        columns of stacked blocks over to the right, as if gravity is pulling the blocks in that direction. Of course, this problem is deceptive. Many might try
                        multiple loops with countless checks in which they slowly slide blocks over to the last columm. However, getting the height of each column and simply 
                        sorting by height will yield the right answer as well.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This got me thinking. Can I reverse this process and create a sorting algorithm. Rather than sorting the heights to find the answer, find the answer to 
                        sort the heights. In theory it would look something like this:
                    </p>

                    
                    <div class="box alt">
                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                            <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/gravity.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        As you can see from the colors, the boxes don't stay with their adjacent neighbors after they fall. But notice what does happen: the new placement is
                        sorted. The initial row lengths were 2,3,1,3. Now they are 1,2,3,3. So how do we get to this diagram on the right? One important thing to note is that
                        since we don't need to make sure that the colors stay next to each other, we can do everything with just numbers. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The method I believe is worth dissecting is using an array to store how many blocks are in each column. So for this example, it would be [4,3,2]. Now,
                        we start from the last index in the array and subtract one till we reach the very beginning. This would leave us with [3,2,1]. And our largest number
                        will be 3. Now we repeat and get that our second largest number is 3 again (since we will do 3 subtractions again). However the third iteration is where
                        things change. Our array is now [2,1,0]. Do we start subtracting into the negatives? 

                        No. We shift our end over to the 1, and continue from there. This will yield us a 2, with the array being modified to [1,0,0]. This leaves our last number
                        to be 1. We know to stop when the first element in the array is 0. Here is the algorithm written in Java:
                    </p>

                    <pre><code>
public static void sorter(Integer[] numbers) {

    //find largest valued element
    int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (numbers[i] > max) {
            max = numbers[i];
        }
    }

    //create temporary array that holds number of blocks in each column
    int[] temp = new int[max];
    for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < numbers[i]; j++) {
            temp[j]++;
        }
    }

    //start subtracting blocks from the end, and count subtractions
    //number of subtractions per pass is equivalent to next sorted
    //element to add to sorted list. Use index pointer to adjust end
    //of temporary array as needed.
    ArrayList<Integer> sorted = new ArrayList<>();
    int idxptr = temp.length - 1;
    while (temp[0] != 0) {
        int removed = 0;
        for (int tempptr = 0; tempptr <= idxptr; tempptr++) {
            temp[tempptr]--;
            removed++;
        }
        while (idxptr >= 0 && temp[idxptr] == 0) {
            idxptr--;
        }
        sorted.add(removed);
    }
}
                    </code></pre>

                    <p> As it can be seen from the algorithm itself, it is not that complex. First the highest value is found, which takes O(N) time, where N is the number
                        of elements you want to sort. Next an array is generated that basically represents the block diagram on the left above, but in a 2d manner. This 
                        takes O(N^2) time. Lastly, instead of sliding the blocks over, we use our algorithm to slowly decrement values until we have nothing left, while
                        making note of what we decrement following our guidelines to yeild a sorted list. The outer while loop is at most O(N) if every element is unique, and
                        the inner loop is roughly O(N) as well, bringing this portion of the code to O(N^2) as well. Thus, at a very simplified level, we are expecting something
                        kind of O(N^2) complexity. Let us see if this holds up after testing.
                    </p>

                    <p> After creating a simple testing set and recording runtimes, the data above is the results I got. Of course, these are not perfect numbers. countless
                        external numbers can come into play in influencing the times, especially the smaller ones, and the best way to minimize this error is by repeating the
                        test. I have personally repeated this test for hours, so I can confidently say that these times are roughly what is outputted on each run. However, if
                        you want to test the algorithm for yourself, code your own testing harness and run my code snippet from above. Or, feel free to download my code from 
                        <a href="https://github.com/aryaagiwal/New-Sorting-Algorithm">this repo</a> and change variables to run your own experiements. 

                        Now let us see what type of order this sorting algorithm is on. 
                    </p>

                    <div class="box alt">
                        <div class="row gtr-50 gtr-uniform">
                            <div class="col-12"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/plot.jpg" alt="" /></span></div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p> The quadratic regression formula generated by my calculator has a correlation coefficient of .9999 and cleaerly fits the points very well as shown
                        above. It is now shown both by logic and by experiementation that the order of this peculiar sorting algorthim is O(N^2). 

                        Though this is nowhere close to as fast as most common sorting algorthims used today, it is still impressive for such a primitive algorithm, and for 
                        something that just passed my mind. If anyone knows if this already exists, then please let me know through my contact page. I doubt that I have 
                        discovered something new, and rather have coincidentally rediscovered a horrible sorting algorithm that clearly should not be used (although I may
                        sneak it into assignments every now and then).
                    </p>
